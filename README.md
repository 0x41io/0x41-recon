**monomi** by 0x41: **passive domain reconnaissance with AI-written analysis.**

Most recon tools hand you a raw list of hostnames. Monomi collects a domain's public footprint and then has Claude explain it in plain English: how the infrastructure is organized, what deserves a closer look, and what the owner can do about it.

> ⚠️ **Authorized use only.** By default Monomi is fully passive: it reads public Certificate Transparency logs and never sends traffic to the target. The optional `--enrich` step adds standard DNS lookups. Even so, only assess domains you own or have permission to review.

---

## Features
- **Subdomain discovery** from Certificate Transparency logs via two sources:
  - [crt.sh](https://crt.sh) (broadest coverage, includes expired certificates)
  - [Cert Spotter](https://sslmate.com/certspotter/) (currently valid certificates, more reliable)
- **Automatic fallback:** if one source is down, the scan continues with the other
- **Merged, de-duplicated results**
- **Hosting enrichment (`--enrich`):** resolves each host to its IP and looks up the network owner (ASN), provider, and country via Team Cymru's free IP-to-ASN service. Shows a host table, a hosting breakdown chart, and flags hosts that point to private/internal IPs in public DNS
- **Change detection:** every scan is saved and compared with the last one, flagging new and removed hostnames
- **AI analysis (optional):** Claude groups hosts by purpose (and by hosting provider when `--enrich` is on), flags names worth reviewing (High / Medium / Low), suggests defensive steps, and states the limits of the data
- **Formatted terminal reports:** the AI report renders in the terminal with colored headings, real tables, and High / Medium / Low badges (via [rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich); plain Markdown if rich isn't installed or `--no-color` is set)
- **Saved reports:** each AI analysis is written to `reports/<domain>_<timestamp>.md`
- **JSON export** for use in other tools

## Installation

Requires Python 3.10+.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0x41io/monomi.git
cd monomi
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### API key (only for `--ai`)

The AI analysis uses the Claude API. Get a key at [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com), then:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key-here"
```

Never commit your key. The tool reads it from the environment only.

By default the tool uses the newest Claude Sonnet model available to your key. To choose a specific model:

```bash
export CLAUDE_MODEL="model-id-here"
```

## Usage

```bash
# Subdomain discovery only (no API key needed)
python monomi.py example.com

# Add IPs, hosting provider/ASN, and country for each host
python monomi.py example.com --enrich

# With AI analysis + saved Markdown report
python monomi.py example.com --ai

# Save raw results as JSON
python monomi.py example.com --json results.json

# Plain output, no colors (also honors the NO_COLOR env var)
python monomi.py example.com --no-color
```

### Example output

```
[*] Target: example.com
[*] Querying certificate transparency logs (crt.sh)...
[+] crt.sh: 412 certificates -> 37 hostnames
[*] Querying certificate transparency logs (Cert Spotter)...
[+] Cert Spotter: 130 certificates -> 29 hostnames

[+] 41 unique hostnames total:

    api.example.com
    status.example.com
    www.example.com
    ...

[*] Asking Claude to analyze the results...
[+] Report saved to reports/example.com_2026-10-03_0643.md
```

A report includes:

1. **Overview** of the public footprint
2. **Infrastructure layout:** hosts grouped by apparent purpose, plus naming patterns
3. **Worth reviewing:** prioritized hosts whose names suggest they may not need to be public
4. **Recommendations:** concrete defensive steps
5. **Limitations:** what passive data can and can't tell you

## How it works

```
domain ──► crt.sh ───────┐
                         ├──► merge + de-duplicate ──► terminal / JSON
domain ──► Cert Spotter ─┘                │
                                          └──► Claude (--ai) ──► Markdown report
```

Certificate Transparency (CT) is a public log of every TLS certificate issued by trusted authorities. Certificates list the hostnames they cover, so CT logs reveal subdomains an organization has requested certificates for, without touching the organization's servers.

## Limitations

- CT logs only show hosts that have had TLS certificates; hosts behind wildcard certificates or without TLS won't appear.
- A hostname appearing in CT logs doesn't mean it's currently live. `--enrich` shows which ones still have DNS records, but a DNS record doesn't prove a server is up.
- AI analysis is based on hostnames alone. Treat its findings as leads to verify, not confirmed issues.
- crt.sh and Cert Spotter are free services and are sometimes slow or rate-limited.

## Roadmap

- [x] DNS + hosting provider enrichment
- [ ] Liveness checks for discovered hosts
- [ ] Scheduled monitoring with alerts on new hostnames
- [ ] Installable package (`pip install monomi`)
- [ ] Web interface
