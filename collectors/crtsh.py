crt.sh subdomain collector.

crt.sh is a public search engine for Certificate Transparency logs. Every
publicly trusted TLS certificate gets logged, and certificates list the
hostnames they cover, so searching for "%.example.com" reveals subdomains
the organization has requested certificates for. This is 100% passive:
we only query crt.sh, never the target itself.
